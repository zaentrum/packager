"""Per-item CMAF packager.

Takes a source file (HEVC video + AAC audio in any container), runs
shaka-packager to emit a streaming-friendly CMAF tree under
/var/lib/katalog/packages/{itemId}/, and writes the manifest.json that
katalog-stream reads when deciding whether to serve a pre-packaged
item or fall through to on-demand transcode.

Design rules (Phase 2 MVP — first cut):
* Video is HEVC passthrough. We never re-encode. If the source video
  codec isn't hevc/h264 we fail the package job; the operator picks a
  different source. This matches the user's "no re-encode" constraint.
* Audio is AAC passthrough when the source track is already AAC,
  otherwise we transcode to AAC-LC 48 kHz stereo via ffmpeg before
  shaka-packager runs (browsers can't decode AC3/DTS/TrueHD natively
  so this is the minimum needed for playback).
* Subtitles are extracted to WebVTT.
* All state is on disk under the per-item output directory. The
  three sentinels {.packaging, .complete, .failed} are mutually
  exclusive and tell every reader where this package is in its
  lifecycle without needing a database round-trip.
